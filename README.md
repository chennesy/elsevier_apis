# Sample Python code for using Scopus APIs.
This GitHub repository includes a [JupyterLab notebook](https://github.com/chennesy/elsevier_apis/blob/main/Scopus_APIs.ipynb) to introduce the Elsevier Scopus Search and Abstract Retrieval Search APIs. It was created as a supplemental document for the conference paper and presentation:

> Hennesy, C., McBurney, J., & Gyendina, M. (2023). "Leveraging scholarly APIs to analyze publication trends." *LibPMC 2023: International Conference on Performance Measurement in Libraries.* July 11, 2023.  

If you are new to Jupyter and/or Python, we recommend following the directions on the [Software Carpentry site](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#python) to download and install Anaconda on your own machine, which includes both Jupyter and Python 3, as well as many of the most common scientific computing libraries for Python. 

*Note: Users without institutional access to Scopus will likely not be able to utilize much of this code to work with Scopus API metadata.*

To run and modify the code in the notebook file in this repository:
1. Download the code using the *Download ZIP* option from the *<> Code* dropdown on this page.
2. Unzip the folder with the code and use the command line to navigate inside of the *elsevier_apis* folder. See instructions for [Mac](https://www.macworld.com/article/221277/command-line-navigating-files-folders-mac-terminal.html) or [Windows 10 or 11](https://www.lifewire.com/change-directories-in-command-prompt-5185508).
3. Use Anaconda to launch a [JupyterLab notebook](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/starting.html) on your laptop by typing ```jupyter lab``` on the command line.
4. From here you can open the *Scopus_APIs.ipynb* file in Jupyter from your browser and follow along with the code.
5. You'll need to register for your own [Elsevier API key](https://dev.elsevier.com/) to make API calls.
6. Also make sure to run this code from a campus computer or using an institutional VPN so you can access Scopus metadata that is licensed by your institution.
